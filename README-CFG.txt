Installation:
-------------

Copy the contents of "inSDroot" to the root of your SD card.
This will add the USB Loader to your homebew channel.
You can also install a a channel forwarder to start the loader directly
from the system menu.
(Note: alternatively, a USB FAT partition can be used
to store configuration and covers)

  Games on FAT/NTFS
    :              usb:/wbfs/GAMEID.wbfs
  or:              usb:/wbfs/TITLE [GAMEID].wbfs
  or:              usb:/wbfs/GAMEID_TITLE/GAMEID.wbfs
  or:              usb:/wbfs/TITLE [GAMEID]/GAMEID.wbfs
  (or sd:/ instead of usb:/)

These are default locations, background and covers are configurable.
If config file is not found in sd:/usb-loader, then it is searched
in: sd:/apps/USBLoader/config.txt (or whichever directory is used to
start from homebrew channel) and if found, the base path is set to
that location.

Besides the global config file sd:/usb-loader/config.txt, also
the config.txt in the apps directory is used, which by default is:
sd:/apps/USBLoader/config.txt but depends from where the loader
has been started from the homebrew channel.

Another way to specify a config file is by using the wiiload
utility from a PC, which allows additional arguments:
C:\> wiiload usbloader.dol config21.txt
which will load sd:/usb-loader/config21.txt
And you can also pass config options directly:
C:\> wiiload usbloader.dol video=ntsc

So you can have different configurations depending on where it
is started from. This can be useful so you can configure the
loader started from forwarder to be simple/childproff, while
if started from homebrew channel to include the installation and
removal options.
To achieve this, copy sd:/apps/USBLoader/ to sd:/apps/USBLoader_admin
and then set simple=1 in sd:/apps/USBLoader/config.txt and edit (or delete)
sd:/apps/USBLoader_admin/meta.xml to show a different name.


USB FAT for config and covers:
------------------------------

SD card is first searched for config.txt, if not found then USB HDD
with a FAT partition is mounted as usb:/ and searched, for config.txt.
in that case, all the paths mentioned above will be searched
on usb:/ instead of sd:/
Advantage of using USB FAT for config and covers is faster loading of
covers. (Usually USB HDD devices are faster than SD cards)
If you want to load the application from SD card but use USB for config
and covers, then copy everything in inSDroot to your USB FAT partition,
but only the inSDroot/apps directory to SD card and
delete sd:/apps/USBLoader/config.txt and sd:/usb-loader/config.txt.

Note: To create 2 partitions on SD or USB thumb drives you have to use
special tools like gparted: http://gparted.sourceforge.net/
Create 2 primary partitions, format both as FAT32 and then inside the loader
re-format the SECOND partition to WBFS. Suggested partitions size if 200MB
for config & covers and the rest for WBFS.

Note: If you have problems accessing the fat partition make sure it is
marked 'active' in the windows partition editor (or if you use gparted,
mark the partition with the 'boot' flag)

Limitations:
- USB FAT is mounted only if config.txt is not found on SD.


Themes:
-------

Another way to customize the loader is by using Themes.
A theme is defined by creating a config file in the location:
sd:/usb-loader/themes/THEME_NAME/theme.txt
And the background images:
sd:/usb-loader/themes/THEME_NAME/background.png
sd:/usb-loader/themes/THEME_NAME/background_wide.png

The options that can be used in theme.txt are described below,
basically only options that define the looks are accepted, everything else
is ignored in theme.txt. Background image (background.png or specified with
background option) for a theme will be searched first in the theme
directory (sd:/usb-loader/themes/THEME_NAME/) and if not found
it will be searched in the base directory (sd:/usb-loader/)

Other themable gui resources:
  favorite.png
  pointer.png
  hourglass.png
  font_uni.png (new type 512 letters unicode)
  font.png (old type 128 letters ascii)
  font_clock.png
  window.png, page.png
  button.png, radio.png, checkbox.png
Same search method as for the background image applies to these files.
There are some example files in: usb-loader/resources, but note that the program
does not search in that location, they need to be copied to the base or theme
directory to be used.

Background overlay support:
additional images can be supplied that will be overlaid over the background:
 - bg_overlay.png or bg_overlay_w.png for console background
 - bg_gui_over.png or bg_gui_over_w.png for gui background
If *_w.png variant is not found then the normal is used.
If a theme is used then the overlay files are searched only in theme directories,
not in base directories.

Auto-scaling of background image:
Since version 41 background width can be larger than 640 and will be either
 - scaled if widescreen
 - cropped if not widescreen
down to 640x480. Note: height must still be 480.

GUI buttons, icons and windows theme images:
button images: button.png, radio.png, checkbox.png
window images: window.png, page.png
States: button images can contain a single button image
or multiple images for different states:
- normal, flash, hover, press, press hover, inactive
Any number of buttons can be present, if some are missing then
the normal state + coloring and effects are used to generate the missing state.
A button width:height must be 2:1, so that the number of states can be
calculated: num = height * 2 / width
Scaling: a button is divided to 3 areas horizontally: 1/4 1/2 1/4 the first
and last are scale proportionally while the middle is streched as much as required.
Round buttons only use the first and last parts.
Similarily a window image is divided also to 3 areas vertically and same rules apply.
The image width and height must be divisible by 4.


GUI Mode:
---------

By default console mode is started.
To switch to GUI mode, press B in main screen.
While in GUI mode, the following buttons are used by default (they can be remapped):
    button A : start selected game
    button B : return to console mode
    button LEFT/RIGHT (Grid): previous/next page
    button LEFT/RIGHT (Coverflow) : rotate to next cover - hold down for fast rotate.
    button UP/Down (Grid) : switch number of rows (1-3)
    button UP (Coverflow) : flip center cover to its back/front
    button DOWN : change gui styles (grid -> flow -> flow-z -> coverflow 3d -> etc)
    button 1, +, - : options, install, remove
    button 2: favorites game list
    button HOME : exit
The background image in GUI mode can be changed with the file:
    sd:/usb-loader/themes/Theme_Name/bg_gui.png  or
    sd:/usb-loader/bg_gui.png


Downloading covers
------------------

Covers can be downloaded for all games at once or on a per-game basis.
To download the covers for all games go to Global Options screen, move
to "<Download All Covers>" and press button RIGHT or LEFT.
There is a difference between LEFT and RIGHT buttons:
- button RIGHT will download all MISSING covers.
- button LEFT will download ALL covers, even the ones that are already present.
To download the covers for the current selected game, go to Game Options screen,
move to "Cover Image:" option and press RIGHT or LEFT. The same difference between
RIGHT and LEFT buttons apply here as with download all covers.
The way how the covers are downloaded can be further customized with config options
download_* and url_*. See the documentation on these options below in the Config file section.

Parental Control and Unlocking Admin Functionality
--------------------------------------------------

If the loader is configured with restricted functionality it can be unlocked
with a password - a "secret" wiimote button combination. Restricted functionality
means any of the options: "simple" or "disable_*" or "hide_game" are set, which is
usually used for "Parental Control".

When admin mode is unlocked it will allow you to access all the previously 
locked functionality. In addition: when unlocked, any games that are hidden
with the hide_game option will be displayed.

To access the unlock screen, hold the 1 button down for 5 seconds and the screen
will appear.  After you see the text "Enter Code:", press the wiimote buttons
in the correct order.  If you were successful, the word SUCCESS will appear
on the screen.  Otherwise the word LOCKED! will appear.  The unlock screen has a 30
second timeout limit so if an incorrect (or no) password is entered, it will
automatically lock.  To set the lock back on with the original settings intact, hold
the 1 button for 5 seconds and the lock will automatically turn on.  When the loader
is started, the lock will always be enabled.

This functionality is controlled by the option: admin_unlock = [1], 0.
By default it is enabled. To disable the ability to unlock admin mode set
the option to: admin_unlock = 0

The default admin unlock password is: BUDAH12
To change it, use the config option: unlock_password = [BUDAH12]
The password length is limited to 10 characters. Do NOT use quotes around the
password - just type what you want it to be.  E.g.  unlock_password = 12UDAB
The following are the button to letter mappings for the password:
      D-Pad Up:     U
      D-Pad Down:   D
      D-Pad Right:  R
      D-Pad Left:   L
      B button:     B
      A Button:     A
      Minus button: M
      Plus button:  P
      Home button:  H
      1 button:     1
      2 button:     2

To hide certain games, use the the Game Options screen and toggle the "Hide Game"
setting.  This allows you to set which games are hidden when the admin mode is LOCKED.
In order to see this option, admin_unlock must be enabled (which it is by default) AND
the admin mode must be in an unlocked state!
- NOTE: this functionality completely replaces the hide_game option in config.txt,
    but they CAN be used together. Any games currently listed in hide_game will be
    shown when unlocked, but will ALWAYS be marked as hidden by default in Game Options
       and cannot be changed to unhidden unless they are removed from config.txt
- NOTE 2: An easy way to convert all your games in hide_game to this new functionality
    is to start the loader with your hide_game still in config.txt and then go into
    Game Options in any game (you may have to unlock admin lock first) and change
    something and save it. All your hide_game entries will automatically be saved.  
    Then you can remove the hide_game entry completely from config.txt.

Title Rename
------------

To rename a game title, edit the file in sd:/usb-loader/titles.txt
or sd:/usb-loader/custom-titles.txt
Format is:
GAMEID = Game Title
Example:
RSPP = Wii Sports



Config file:
------------


# lines starting with # are comments
# default values are in [ ]
#
# There are 2 categories of options: Global and Theme
#   Theme options (theme.txt) only affect the looks, everything else is ignored
#   Global options (config.txt) will accept all options, including theme options.
#
#
# Theme options:
# ==============
#
# background = [background.png]
# wbackground = [background_wide.png]
#   file to use for the background image.
#   file can be an absolute path (like sd:/somedir/myimage.png)
#   if the specified background is not an absolute path it is searched
#   in theme directory (sd:/usb-loader/themes/THEME_NAME/)
#   and in default directory (sd:/usb-loader)
#
# background_base = [background.png]
# wbackground_base = [background_wide.png]
#   base background image over which the bg_overlay* files are overlaid.
#   actually this option is the same as normal background option
