19-01-2011 cfg v65a (alpha)
 - Updated libfat to svn-4520 which includes FSINFO (by Dimok)
   FAT fsinfo stores the free space info to a designated sector
   speeding up the time it takes to print the free space.
   Previously the entire FAT table had to be scanned to get the
   free space which could take up to a couple of minutes.
   This was also the reason the option hide_hddinfo=1 is set
   so that by default the free space is not displayed .
 - Added a way to manually scan and sync the free space in fsinfo.
   Go to global options / partition selection and press 2
   Then all FAT filesystems will be shown and the free space for each
   By confirming with A the free space will be scanned again. If the
   scanned free space mathces fsinfo OK is displayed otherwise the
   correct free space, which is then stored to fsinfo.
   It is enough to do this once, after that the fsinfo should be kept
   in sync. (but using some other homebrew to write/delete data from
   FAT will make the info unsynced again, until all other apps are upgraded
   with the new libfat as well)

04-03-2010 cfg v55a (alpha)

 - Added new values to the home and button_* options:
    priiloader - uses the Priiloader magic word "Daco" to go to Priiloader menu
    wii_menu - uses the Priiloader magic word "Pune" to go to Wii Menu
    Any other Priiloader magic word can be entered as text (no others exist yet)
    Any channel ID can be entered, e.g., FDCL for pepxl's forwarder

 Cool Usage Ideas:
   To go to Wii Menu when using Priiloader:
     home = wii_menu
     #OR
     home = Pune
   To implement a restart function after updates:
     home = FDCL #replace with your forwarder's ID
     button_H = exit
     # Because of the implementation of the options,
     # This makes the home button restart Cfg when
     # used in a menu like the global menu, and 
     # exit when used in the game list or GUI. 
   Implement multiple exit types and channel launchers:
     button_B = FDCL # reboot via forwarder
     button_1 = HATP # launch PAL Nintendo Channel
     button_2 = etc.


03-03-2010 cfg v54 (release)

23-02-2010 cfg v53 (release)

 - New option: load_unifont = [0], 1
   Specifies if unifont.dat should be loaded or not. unifont.dat contains
   all the unicode characters, required for Asian (CJK) language support
   so that translation or wiitdb info shows up correctly.
   Note: the Latin unicode set is already embedded into the loader,
   so to display German, French, Spanish, etc... unifont.dat is not needed
 - Renamed the included Chinese translation files according to standard:
   SChinese.lang -> ZH_CN.lang (Simplified Chinese)
   CHT.lang      -> ZH_TW.lang (Traditional Chinese)

   Note: only use 222 for loader, 223 and 224 will freeze if used for loader,
   however 223/224 work fine for games. That means, don't put ios=223-mload in
   config.txt, but it's ok if it is set for a specific game in options screen.
 - New option value for ios: 224-mload
 - Support for HDDs with 4k sectors (WBFS partition only)

     Set this option to ignore titles from the database

 About button remapping: 
  Firstly, the guitar default mappings have changed slightly.
    The new mappings are as follows:
    RED = A; GREEN = B; YELLOW = X; BLUE = Y; ORANGE = Z.

  Each of the following buttons can now have its own action:
  B, -, +, 1, 2, Home, X, Y, Z, C, L & R.

  These actions are valid for the console game list and the GUI 
  mode only.  For options that affect the menus, see below.
  The new options for this type of mapping are all theme options
  with config.txt overrides and are as follows:	
   option: button_B = [gui], <other actions>
           button_- = [main_menu], <other actions>
           button_+ = [install], <other actions>
           button_H = [reboot], <other actions>
           button_1 = [options], <other actions>
           button_2 = [favorites], <other actions>
           button_X = A, B, 1, [2], H, -, +, <action>
           button_Y = A, B, [1], 2, H, -, +, <action>
           button_Z = A, [B], 1, 2, H, -, +, <action>
           button_C = [A], B, 1, 2, H, -, +, <action>
           button_L = A, B, 1, 2, H, [-], +, <action>
           button_R = A, B, 1, 2, H, -, [+], <action>
  These buttons can be mapped to any of the following actions:
     nothing    # does nothing
     options    # access game options
     gui        # switch to/from GUI
     reboot     # reboot to system menu
     exit       # exit to launching app
     hbc        # exit to HBC
     screenshot # take a screenshot
     install    # install a game
     remove     # remove a game
     main_menu  # access main menu 
     global_ops # access global options menu
     favorites  # toggle favorites view
     boot_game  # boot a game from the drive
     boot_disc  # boot a game from disc
     theme      # switch to next theme
     profile    # switch to next profile
     unlock     # access the unlock password dialog immediately
  As shown, X, Y, Z, C, L & R can also be optionally targetted to 
  emulate one of the buttons on the Wiimote (A, B, 1, 2, -, +, Home).
  If used this way, this emulation will also work in menus.

  As stated, the other options allow you to select the default
  action in the game list and GUI mode only.  The menus can be
  remapped by specifying which buttons affect which commands.
  These options take a commas separated list of button names from the
  following list:
    B, 1, 2, -, M, Minus, +, P, Plus, H, Home, X, Y, Z, C, L, R

  The following are the mappable commands.  All the options are theme
  options with overrides in config.txt.

   option: button_cancel = [B], <comma separated list of buttons>
     Set which button(s) will act as the back button in menus

   option: button_exit = [Home], <comma separated list of buttons>
     Set which button(s) will perform the 'home' action in menus

   option: button_other = [1], <comma separated list of buttons>
     Set which button(s) will perform the other or alternate action in menus
     This covers switching between options and global options, choosing to
     download BCA during install, choosing to ignore meta.xml during upgrade etc.

   option: button_save = [2], <comma separated list of buttons>
     Set which button(s) will perform the save action in menus

 EXAMPLES:
   To switch buttons B & 1 around so that 1 operates as GUI while
   B operates as back:
     button_B = options
     button_1 = gui
     button_other = B
     button_cancel = 1
   To make both the L and R buttons on a GameCube controller
   operate as back buttons in the menus in addition to B:
     button_cancel = B, L, R
   Plug in the Classic controller and you can have any twelve
   different actions available at once (with A being boot_game):
     button_B = gui
     button_1 = options
     button_2 = favorites
     button_- = profile
     button_+ = theme
     button_H = exit
     button_L = remove
     button_R = install
     button_X = main_menu
     button_Y = global_ops
     button_Z = boot_disc

06-02-2010 cfg v52b2 (beta2)
 - File custom-titles.txt in the base directory is searched 
   for game titles.
 - Titles are extracted from wiitdb.zip but can be overridden 
   with either titles file.
 - The titles precedence (highest to lowest) is as follows:
     - custom-titles.txt
     - titles.txt
     - wiitdb.zip
     - directory name (FAT & NTFS only)
     - game image
 - When saving global options, the saved settings are listed.
 - Console color fixes (Dr. Clipper)
 - Play time logging to message board (marc_max & Dr. Clipper)
     When enabled, this option will put the correct title
     and play time into the Wii Message Board log and will
     also be read by the Nintendo Channel.  However, this will
     usually fail if you skip the Wii Menu via BootMii or 
     Priiloader autoboot.
 - option: write_playlog = [0],1 
     Note, it is disabled by default as this fix changes your
     Wii's NAND and cannot be used via autoboot methods.

31-01-2010 cfg v52b (beta)

     option: db_language = [AUTO], EN, JA, German, etc
 - option: "-asc" is no longer necessary to specify a sort as ascending.
 - db_show_info no longer hides the hdd info or footer in the console.

   When loading games from FAT or NTFS
 - Added {PUB} to cover url options.
   {PUB} will be replaced by the last two characters of the ID
   (the publisher)
   This can be used to do things like forcing NTSC covers for 
   PAL games by replacing {CC} with US and {ID6} with {ID3}E{PUB}

21-12-2009 cfg v50c (bugfix)

 - Fixed starting games from SD Card with FAT or NTFS

16-12-2009 cfg v50 (release)

   External ehcmodules for these versions are still supported
 - Use the new ehcmodule with fat/ntfs support also for wbfs
   (but still uses wbfs mode for wbfs partition)
   Can be overriden using an external ehcmodule4
   External module for fat/wbfs has been renamed
   from ehcmodule_fat.elf to ehcmodule_frag.elf
 - In case the new fragments method fails for any reason for FAT
   it will fallback to the old method
 - Other cleanups

14-12-2009 cfg v50b (beta)

 - .iso files on NTFS support
   The file name layout is the same as for .wbfs files:
   /wbfs/gameid.iso or /wbfs/gameid_title/gameid.iso
 - Fixes and cleanups for NTFS support (fixed ntfs getf -1 error)
 - option: partition=ntfs1 accepted

 About NTFS support: 

    FAT support in ehcmodule has been rewritten with a new
    generic wii disc emulation system that is:
    - light weight / zero overhead
    - filesystem independent
    - fileformat independent
    It works by supplying the ehcmodule with a list of sector fragments
    that specify the location of data using direct sector addressing.
    To see the list of fragments one can use debug=1 and they will
    be printed out before starting the game.
    The number of fragments if limited to 5000, that number is also
    the max theoretical number of fragments on a wbfs partition (actually
    4600, for a dual layer disc with a 2mb wbfs block size). In normal
    conditions the number of fragments should be a lot lower most commonly
    just a single big block. Fragments are used to describe both physical
    address on hdd and virtual adress on wii disc so if a .wbfs file is used
    the list will be composed of 3 fragments - disc header, update partition
    and game partition.
    libntfs however doesn't seem stable enough for write access at the moment,
    so the ntfs partition is mounted read-only meaning install and remove can't
    be done from inside the loader for now.

 Credits: WiiPower for libntfs modification which returns the list of fragments.

   (from a channel created with crap or similar tools)
   and option: intro=0 is specified then no intro
   and no progress is displayed while the game is being loaded
 - Support for .wip game patches (by WiiPower)
   Loaded from: sd:/usb-loader/GAMEID.wip (text format)

 - Presing button A on global options screen works too (same as right)

15-11-2009 cfg v48a (alpha)

 - Profiles - aka multiple favorite groups
   option: profile_names = [default], name2, name3,...
   (max profiles:10, max profile name length: 16)
   Profiles can be added, removed and reordered with this option.
   But if you want to rename it, you will need to change the profile
   name also in settings.cfg otherwise it will be considered as a new
   name and the old one will be forgotten next time you save settings.
   Profiles can be switched in the global options screen. Changing a
   game favorite setting is done as usual in the game options screen.
   option: profile = name will specify the default profile to use
   saving global settings will also save which profile is used

 - Fixed banner sounds with games that have upper case OPENING.BNR
   (Thanks to RolloS60 from wiicoverflow)
 - Cleanups

06-11-2009 cfg v47a (alpha)

 - Better compatibility with weird WBFS partition setups:
 - WBFS on RAW disk device, without a partition table
   With such a setup the partition table will look like this:
    P# Size(GB) Type Mount Used
    -----------------------------
    RAW  500.00 WBFS1      [USED]

 - WBFS on EXTENDED partition. Normally a filesystem should
   reside on either a primary or logical partition, never on
   an extended partition. Extended is just a container of logical
   partitions. However older version allowed this setup and so
   the support for it is back. The partition table will look like:
    P# Size(GB) Type Mount Used
    -----------------------------
    P#1  500.00 EXTEND/WBFS1 [USED]
   And the loader will also let you fix the partition table by
   pressing 1, which will change the partition type from EXTEND to
   a known data type (0x0b, which is also used for fat)

01-11-2009 cfg v46 (release)

 - Support for direct launching of games from fat
   (Useful for game channel launching, using loadstructor or similar tool)
   To specify direct loading from fat, the parameter has to be in form: #GAMEID-X
   Where X is 0-3 for wbfs and 4-9 for fat partitions (4 means first fat partition)
 - Automatically switch to ios222 in case ios249 is used for starting games from fat
 - Only allow IOS 222 and 223 in game options if fat partition is selected
 - Improved drawing speed in some coverflow gui modes
 - Cleanups

30-10-2009 cfg v46b (beta)

 - Added option: partition = [WBFS1], ..., WBFS4, FAT1, ..., FAT9, ask
 - Saving global settings will also save current selected partition
 - Increased fat cache size in IOS module
 - Load FAT module in IOS early in case config has: 
   ios=222-mload (or ios=223-mload) and partition=FAT*
   So that IOS does not need to be reloaded another time before
   starting the game from a FAT partition
 - Added indication in global options if [FAT] module is loaded in IOS
 - Cleanups

26-10-2009 cfg v46a2 (alpha2)

 - Faster loading of game list from a fat partition - should be instant now.
   The only thing that has a slight delay is showing the hdd free space
   in console mode game list (if it is enabled)
 - Create game info file after installing on a FAT partition named:
   usb:/wbfs/GAMEID_TITLE.txt This makes it easier to tell the titles
   of installed games when using a filesystem explorer
 - Rephrased the warning message when no WBFS partition found
 - Allow to select partition if no wbfs partition is found and disable_format is on.
 - Minor cleanups in partition selection

 - Loading games from a FAT32 partitions. The game file has to
   be located and named like this: usb:/wbfs/GAMEID.wbfs

 - Updated ehcmodule for IOS222-mload from uLoader 3.1
 - Fixed disable_format option

   Can be tuned with option: gui_antialias = [4] {0-4}
 - cios 222/223 rev4 support:

   Note: 6 letter ID in titles.txt was supported before but just 4 were used.
 - Show a note in the global options screen if there are multiple config.txt
   files used (one in base and another in apps/... dir)
 - Fixed occasional crash with the combination of

 - Minor fixes (thanks to wiimm)

01-09-2009 cfg v42a (alpha)

 - Ability to force progressive mode: (from NeoGamma)
 - Split 'patch' video mode to a separate option:
   video_patch = [0], 1, all
 - 'video_patch = all' will force all modes to the selected video mode.
   This will also force progressive / interlaced mode, depending on what
   is configured in wii settings. This can be used for example to force
   progressive mode if the game will otherwise use interlaced mode (MPT)
 - The equivalent of the old video = patch is now:
     video = system
     video_patch = 1
   This will patch NTSC -> PAL modes if console is PAL
   and PAL -> NTSC modes if console is NTSC
   This will not change interlaced / progressive mode

 - Allow wiird to work if ocarina is enabled and no codes are found.


21-08-2009 cfg v41 (release)

17-08-2009 cfg v41a (alpha)

 - Improved theming:

 - Background overlay support
   additional images can be supplied that will be overlaid over the background:
   - bg_overlay.png or bg_overlay_w.png for console background
   - bg_gui_over.png or bg_gui_over_w.png for gui background
   If *_w.png variant is not found then the normal is used.
   New options:
   - background_base
   - wbackground_base
   - background_gui
   - wbackground_gui
   Used to specify the background base over which the overlays are applied.

 - background width can be larger than 640 and will be either
   - scaled if widescreen
   - cropped if not widescreen
   down to 640x480. Note: height must still be 480.

 - Option layout no longer re-sets the covers_size and wcovers_size
   So that a cover_style or [w]cover_size in front of layout works as expected.


09-08-2009 cfg v40 (release)

 - Increased timeout for entering password to 30 seconds
 - Renamed option admin_lock to admin_unlock as that better describes
   what it does - it allows you to unlock admin functionality
 - Fixed option unlock_password

08-08-2009 cfg v40b3 (beta3)

 - uLoader cIOS 222/223 rev3 support
 - both rev2 and rev3 are supported
 - ehcmodule for rev2 is updated to uloader 2.5
 - ehcmodule for rev3 is from uloader 2.8D
 - external ehcmodule for rev2 has to be named: ehcmodule.elf
 - external ehcmodule for rev3 has to be named: ehcmodule3.elf
   
 - Minor GUI speed optimizations of rendering and cover loading

 - Admin unlock by password

 - Hide games from settings screen

 - Added new config option (admin_lock = 0,[1]) for admin locking (i.e. Parental Mode).
   When this setting is enabled, it will allow all screens normally locked by the
   simple or disable_* settings to be unlocked via a "secret" wiimote button combination.
   In addition: when unlocked, any covers that are hidden with the hide_game option will
   be displayed.  To access the unlock screen, hold the 1 button down for 5-10 seconds
   and the screen will appear.  After you see the text "Enter Code:", press the wiimote
   buttons in the correct order.  If you were successful, the word SUCCESS will appear
   on the screen.  Otherwise the word LOCKED! will appear.  The unlock screen has a 15
   second timeout limit so if an incorrect (or no) password is entered, it will
   automatically lock.  To set the lock back on with the original settings intact, hold
   the 1 button for 5-10 seconds and the lock will automatically turn on.  When the loader
   is started, the lock will always be enabled, so there is no need to manually set the
   lock before you let the kiddies play.  :)
   - NOTE: this option is enabled by default.
 - Added new config option (unlock_password = [BUDAH12]) to allow a custom button
   combination to be used for the admin_lock password.  
   - NOTE: The password length is limited to 10 characters.  Do NOT use quotes around the
     password - just type what you want it to be.  E.g.  unlock_password = 12UDAB
   - The following are the button mappings for the password:
      D-Pad Up:     U
      D-Pad Down:   D
      D-Pad Right:  R
      D-Pad Left:   L
      B button:     B
      A Button:     A
      Minus button: M
      Plus button:  P
      Home button:  H
      1 button:     1
      2 button:     2
 - Automatically hide uLoader's CFG entry, so hide_game=__CF is no longer needed.
 - Added new option on the Game Options screen called "Hide Game".  This allows you
   to set which games are hidden when the admin lock is LOCKED.  In order to see this
   option, admin_lock must be enabled (which it is by default) AND the admin lock must
   be in an unlocked state!
   - NOTE: this functionality completely replaces the hide_game option, but they CAN
     be used together.  Any games currently listed in hide_game will ALWAYS be marked
     as hidden by default in Game Options and cannot be unhidden until they are removed
     from hide_game.  
   - NOTE 2: An easy way to convert all your games in hide_game to this new functionality
     is to start the loader with your hide_game still in config.txt and then go into
     Game Options in any game (you may have to unlock admin lock first) and change
     something and save it.  All your hide_game entries will automatically be saved.  
     Then you can remove the hide_game entry completely from config.txt.

   force download all covers. This is valid for per-game cover download and for downloading
   covers for all games.

   back cover and then rotate back up to 0 degrees to flip to the front.

22-07-2009 cfg v37ax (alpha-experimental ***SEE NOTE!)

 - Same changes as v37a, but with new libfat for improved cover loading speed.
   - NOTE: DO NOT USE THIS if your usb-loader directory is on a USB drive!  It will NOT mount your FAT
     partition.  This is just a preview release for people who have all their covers / themes /

 - Changed the way cover_url options work:
 - cover_url* are now global instead of theme options.
 - Added per cover style url options:
   cover_url - standard (2d) covers

 - Note: These options still work and do the same:
   cover_url_norm, cover_url_3d_norm, cover_url_disc_norm
 - Downloading covers in widescreen mode will no longer download resized
   widescreen covers, instead full covers are downloaded and then resized
   when they are being displayed. In other words, cover_url_*_norm is used
   always instead of cover_url_*_wide in widescreen mode.
   To revert this to previous behaviour, use the option:
   download_wide = [0], 1 Which will use cover_url_*_wide options in widescreen mode:
   cover_url_wide
   cover_url_3d_wide
   cover_url_disc_wide
 - Note: ID_wide.png covers are still used if found in widescreen mode.

18-04-2009 cfg v13:

 - Support running games from a SD/SDHC Card with a WBFS and FAT32 partition.
   So you can have the loader, covers, background and other configuration files
   on the FAT partition and games on WBFS partition.
   Note: this worked in waninkoko original 1.4 but seems broken in 1.5.
 - Minor fixes to download covers from internet (tnx: Don Killah)
 - Fixed simple=1 option

18-04-2009 cfg v12:

 - fine granularity of simple options:
   added options: disable_remove, disable_install, disable_options, disable_format
   by default none of this is set.
   setting simple=1 will change all of these disable_xxx options and
   hide_hddinfo and hide_footer to 1 and confirm_start to 0.
   setting simple=0 will do the opposite.
   any of the disable_xxx, hide_xxx and confirm_start options can be set individually.
 - allow absolute paths for background (like sd:/somedir/myimage.png)
   if the specified background is not an absolute path it is searched
   in default directory (sd:/usb-loader)
 - option: install_partitions = [all], only_game
 - minor stuff: background version, fixed default apps/USBLoader/config.txt
